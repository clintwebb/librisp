This chat server has a very simple protocol.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROTOCOL REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  INITIALIZATION
  --------------

   1.  When the server starts up, it listens on a particular port.
   2.  Clients connect to the server.
   3.  Server accepts the connection, but does not send anything immediately.
   4.  Client sends HELLO("RISP Server") command. 
   5.  If client sends the correct HELLO ID, Server replies with HELLO_ACK, and session is established.
   6.  If client sent an invalid HELLO command, Server will drop the connection without sending any response.
   7.  Default state of a session is NOFOLLOW and NOECHO.
   8.  If the client takes longer than 10 seconds to send the HELLO command, the server will close 
       the connection.
   9.  The client must send a HELLO command before any other command except NOP.
  10.  If any other command is received before a HELLO (besides NOP), then the connection will be closed.
  11.  The client implementation should also close the connection if it sends a HELLO, but doesn't get 
       an answering HELLO_ACK within a reasonable time.
  12.  Client can send a NAME command to set the name for all proceeding messages that are sent.


  SENDING MESSAGES
  ----------------

   1.  If the client wants to associate a name with the connection (ie, "Alice Bogwarts"), then it can send a 
       NAME command.
   2.  Whatever is set as the Name will be remembered for the session.
   3.  If the client is servicing multiple people, it can send a NAME command before each MESSAGE 
       command that it sends.
   4.  A NAME command can be sent at any time.  The server will simply remember and use the last one.
   5.  To send a message to all other people watching the chat session, the client sends a MESSAGE 
       command.  
   6.  If a message is sent without a NAME, then it given a NULL name.
   7.  The client can choose to receive their own messages, or not.  By submitting an ECHO command, 
       it will turn on echoes for that session.  This means that when a client sends a message, it 
       will immediately receive the same message back.
   8.  If the client want to choose not to receive their own messages, it can send a NO_ECHO command.  
       By default a session will not echo.
   9.  All messages sent are relayed on to every client that is connected to the server.  There is 
       no capability of sending a message to a limited group.

 
  RECEIVING MESSAGES
  ------------------

   1.  Clients by default are in NO_FOLLOW mode, where they do not automatically receive every new 
       message received.  
   2.  Whenever a new message is posted, clients that are in NOFOLLOW mode (the default) will receive:
          - LATEST_MSG_ID command
   3   Whenever a new message is posted, clients that are in FOLLOW mode will receive:
          - MSG_ID command
          - NAME command
          - MESSAGE command
       Clients should make note of the MSG_ID command, and update its own internal tracking of the 
       latest message.
   4.  Whenever a new message is posted, clients that are in NOUPDATE mode, will receive nothing at all.
   5.  The client can request a specific message, by sending a SEND_MSG command. 
   6.  The client can specify to receive all messages since a specific ID by sending the SEND_SINCE 
       command.  The server will send all the messages since that particular ID.   In other words, 
       it is saying "the last message I got was XXXX, send every message since then".
   7.  There is no restriction on the contents of the Name, other than it is 255 characters in 
       length or less.  It is up to the client to parse it to ensure it can print/handle the 
       contents of it.

     
  DISCONNECTING
  -------------
   1.  Server will disconnect a client if it has received no activity in a certain time period 
       (5 minutes).  ACTUALLY NOT IMPLEMENTED IN THIS EXAMPLE.
   2.  Client can close the connection.
   3.  Client can send a GOODBYE command which will cause the server to close the connection.
   4.  After sending the GOODBYE command, the client should not send any more data over the 
       connection.




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// 1 byte integer - 0x0000 to 0x0fff         0 000 xxxx xxxx
// 2 byte integer - 0x1000 to 0x1fff         0 001 xxxx xxxx	
// 4 byte integer - 0x2000 to 0x2fff         0 010 xxxx xxxx
// 8 byte integer - 0x3000 to 0x3fff         0 011 xxxx xxxx

    0x3000  MSG_ID (Server to Client)

        ID of a message.  Normally only sent from the Server to the client when it is sending a 
        message that is being relayed.  

    0x3001  LATEST_MSG_ID (Server to Client)

        ID of the latest message in the system.  Normally sent from the server when the client is in 
        NO_FOLLOW mode.  Also sent when the client sends a GET_LATEST_MSG_ID command.

    0x3002  SEND_MSG (Client to Server)

        Client sends this command to the server, when asking for a particular message to be sent.  
        The parameter indicates the message ID that should be sent.

    0x3003  SEND_SINCE (Client to Server)

        Client requests that all messages since a certain msg ID to be sent.   If no messages to be 
        sent, then server may only send a LATEST_MSG_ID command. 

// 16 byte integer - 0x4000 to 0x4fff        0 100 xxxx xxxx
// 32 byte integer - 0x5000 to 0x5fff        0 101 xxxx xxxx
// 64 byte integer - 0x6000 to 0x6fff        0 110 xxxx xxxx
// No Parameters - 0x7000 to 0x7fff          0 111 xxxx xxxx

    0x7000  NOP (Bi-directional)
    
        Does nothing.  This command can be used for padding by 2 bytes (the size of a command). Not 
        very practical, and other NOP command sizes could be added to the protocol to add arbitrary 
        lengths of padding.  Can also be used to keep a connection alive, as any received data 
        (valid commands or not) will reset the counter.
    
    0x7001  HELLO_ACK (Server to Client)

        When the server receives a HELLO command, and it has the correct ID string, it will respond 
        with an ACK.  There is no HELLO_FAIL, as the server will simply close the connection if it 
        does not receive the correct ID string.
    
    0x7002  GOODBYE (Client to Server)
    
        If the client wants to close the connection, it can either close it, or send a GOODBYE 
        message to the server, and the server will close the connection.  In some cases it is 
        preferred that the client tells the server to close the connection.  This ensures that there 
        is no pending data to be received when the close takes place.

    0x7003  ECHO (Client to Server)
    
        Puts the session in ECHO mode, where new messages received by the server will be sent to all 
        the clients, including the client that sent the message.  This is not the default.
    
    0x7004  NO_ECHO (Client to Server)
    
        Puts the session in NO_ECHO mode, where new messages received by the server will be sent to 
        all the clients except the one that sent the message.  This is the default mode.
    
    0x7005  FOLLOW (Client to Server)
    
        Puts the session in FOLLOW mode.  When new messages are received by the server, it will send 
        the entire message to this client session.  This allows a client to receive the messages in 
        the most efficient manner.  (DEFAULT)
    
    0x7006  NO_FOLLOW (Client to Server)
    
        Puts the session in NO_FOLLOW mode (the default), where the client will receive a 
        LATEST_MSG_ID command when new commands come in, but that only indicates the latest msg ID, 
        and not the full message.  This allows clients to be aware that there are more messages 
        pending, but not necessarily receive them.  The client can request particular messages, or 
        all the messages since a particular ID.

    0x7007  NO_UPDATE (Client to Server)

        Similar to NO_FOLLOW except it also does not send the LATEST_MSG_ID command.  The client, in 
        order to get updates, will need to send the GET_LATEST_MSG_ID command to find out what the 
        latest message is.  Clients that only intend to send messages and not receive them might 
        prefer this mode.

        Clients cannot specifically reset this setting by itself, but FOLLOW will reset it.  
        NO_UPDATE implies that NO_FOLLOW has also been set.

        NOTE: In this mode, if clients send a message they still get the SENT_MSG_ID command.

    
    0x7008  GET_LATEST_MSG_ID (Client to Server)
    
        Tells the server to send a LATEST_MSG_ID commmand to indicate what the latest msg ID is.  
        Commonly used when in NO_UPDATE mode to periodically check for new messages.
    

// 1 byte-length string - 0x8000 to 0x8fff   1 000 xxxx xxxx

    0x8000  HELLO (Client to Server)

        Authentication (although admittedly almost non-existant) ensures that the client and server 
        are attempting to talk correctly.  The string supplied must be "RISP Server".  There is no 
        version numbers applied, as a properly designed  RISP protocol should not require versioning.  
        A better solution is to use the Capabilites methodology.

        If the string is incorrect, the server will not respond, but simply close the connection.

        NOTE:  The HELLO command with the supplied string could allow a RISP reverse-proxy to direct 
               traffic to different responders.  It could simply listen on a socket and when 
               connections come in, process the HELLO command, and depending on the string, simply 
               shuffle all following traffic (including the HELLO) to different listeners.

    0x8001  NAME (Bi-directional)

        Sets the name of the message.  When sent from the client, the server will remember the name 
        for the session.  The client can send it as many times as it wants, and the server will only 
        remember the last one.  All future messages from the client will be sent with that stored Name.
        
        When sent from the Server, it will be sent prior to a Message command that was relayed from 
        another client.
        
// 2 byte-length string - 0x9000 to 0x9fff   1 001 xxxx xxxx

	0x9000  MESSAGE  (Bi-directional)
    
        When sent from a client, will take that parameter, and pass it (along with the msg ID and 
        name) to the other clients, depending on their FOLLOW or UPDATE modes.

        When sent from server to client, indicates that a message was received at the server, and 
        relayed to the client.  Will also be accompanied by a MSG_ID and a NAME command before the 
        MESSAGE.
        
        The MSG_ID can be used to update the ID of the latest message.  

        If the server is sending multiple messages from the same Name, it will only send Name once, 
        followed by the multiple messages.  Only when messages are being sent from different names, 
        will those entries also be included.
    
// 4 byte-length string - 0xa000 to 0xafff   1 010 xxxx xxxx
// 8 byte-length string - 0xb000 to 0xbfff   1 011 xxxx xxxx
// No Parameters - 0xc000 to 0xffff          1 1xx xxxx xxxx



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROTOCOL DESIGN CHOICES AND OPTIMISATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1.  We have multiple commands that deal with a MSG_ID.   We could have used a single command to 
      set the message ID, and then have an additional command that tells the server what to do with 
      that command.  And technically that is the proper RISP way.  However, there are certain 
      optimisations that can help speed up processing.  Doing it the way just mentioned, would 
      result in TWO callback methods being called.  Since this protocol is fairly small and 
      uncomplicated, then we can optimise slightly by having a single command with an ID parameter 
      that includes the ID being processed, and the command operation.   This only really applies 
      with simply protocols that really only deal with a single key element (in this case the 
      message ID).

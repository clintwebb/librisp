one way that we might be able to process more data quickly, is if we have multiple worker threads.  We will not want a 
lot of threads, and certainly not a 1:1 ratio against the number of sockets we are processing.  But maybe 1 or more 
worker threads that only process the data in the buffers, and sleep when there are no buffers to process.

To ensure that the worker threads do not cause the network threads to wait, each node object should contain a dual set of 
buffers.  One that is used for the network thread to add new data, and one for the worker thread that will be processiing 
it.  Therefore there would only need to be a mutex around the writing to the buffer, and when the worker thread wants to 
process it, it will move the 'pending' buffer over to the 'processing' buffer.


To pause a thread until a condition changes:
pthread_cond_wait()

One last change I'm going to make, is the original library was called librisp, but that only supported 32-bit integers.

So I made librisp64 which changed the protocol to support 64-bit integers.

But... now the '64' doesn't really mean much as the protocol now supports way more than 64...  so I'm going to change the library name 
back to librisp, instead of librisp64

This feature wont change the sub-protocol at all.

The 3.30.00 branch is intended to add functionality to better handle large messages.  It also is intended to update all the supporting 
documentation like the RISP book, and the example code.

This release has been aborted due to new developments on improving the sub-protocol.
We will therefore be jumping to a 4.00 version.

This new protocol is expected to be the final iteration of the protocol, 
and should be fairly future-proof.

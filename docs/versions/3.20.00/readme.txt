Release 3.20.00 is a small release primarily to add manpages for the various functions, and change the risp handle from a structure to 
just a pointer.  Evevn though the structure contents are available in source, it makes it less tempting to modify the contents of it 
without using the functions.

Main Changes:
 * risp_t
 * manpages
